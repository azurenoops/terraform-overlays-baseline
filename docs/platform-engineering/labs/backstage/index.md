# Get started

The goal of this lab is for you to learn how to configure and deploy a Backstage instance to Azure. We will start by initializing anc configuring Backstage to work with GitHub or Azure DevOps. In further labs we will then define the infrastructure and deploy it to Azure.

This should give you a good understanding of how to use terrform to deploy infrastructure to Azure and how to use Backstage for your Internal Developer Portal.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- [Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started)

There is also a devcontainer.json file in this repository which you can use to spin up a devcontainer with all the tools installed. Highly recommended if you are using VSCode, GitHub Codespaces or GitHub Copilot.
