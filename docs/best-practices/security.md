# Security

Security in Terraform is a broad topic, and this guide is intended to provide a high-level overview of the security features available in Terraform and best practices for using them.

## Security Features

Terraform provides several security features to help you secure your infrastructure and resources. Some of the key security features include:

- **State Management**: Terraform uses a state file to store the state of your infrastructure. The state file contains sensitive information, such as resource IDs and secrets, so it's important to secure it. Terraform provides several options for state management, including remote state storage and state locking, to help you secure your state file.

- **Providers**: Terraform providers are responsible for managing resources in a specific cloud or on-premises environment. Providers are responsible for authenticating to the cloud or environment and managing resources. Terraform provides several security features for providers, including authentication methods, access control, and encryption.

- **Variables**: Terraform allows you to define variables to parameterize your configurations. Variables can be used to store sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys. Terraform provides several options for securing variables, including sensitive variables and encrypted variables.

- **Modules**: Terraform modules allow you to encapsulate infrastructure configurations into reusable components. Modules can be used to define security best practices and enforce security policies. Terraform provides several options for securing modules, including versioning, access control, and encryption.
