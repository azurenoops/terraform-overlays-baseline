## Azure Monitor Agent (May 2023)

Similarly, as Microsoft Monitor Agent (MMA) is on a deprecation path, Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) is the recommended replacement and there are a number of requests to support AMA specific policies. AMA is currently in preview, and we are working with the product group to ensure that the policies are updated as soon as possible. Some policies are ready, however, the initiative to activate all components is still being worked on.
