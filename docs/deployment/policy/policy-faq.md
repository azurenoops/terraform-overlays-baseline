## Azure Monitor Agent (May 2023)

Similarly, as Microsoft Monitor Agent (MMA) is on a deprecation path, Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) is the recommended replacement and there are a number of requests to support AMA specific policies. AMA is currently in preview, and we are working with the product group to ensure that the policies are updated as soon as possible. Some policies are ready, however, the initiative to activate all components is still being worked on.

## Why are there custom policy definitions as part of this implementation?

We work with and learn from our customers and partners. This collaboration helps us evolve and enhance the reference implementations to meet customer and partner requirements. As part of this interaction with customers and partners, we might notice policy definition gaps. In those cases, we create and test a definition to fill the gap and include it in enterprise-scale architecture for everyone to use.

We then work with the Azure Policy and associated engineering teams to continuously transition the new custom policy definitions into built-in policy definitions.

## Where can I see the policy definitions used by the Mission Enclave Policy starter implementation?

You can find a list of policy definitions here: [Policies included in Mission Enclave Policy starter implementations](./ALZ-Policies)
